Simulations of all single qudit gates for 3 and 5 level qudits. Assumptions: microwave, thus equal polarizations.
Simulated with and without "noise". "Noise" simulated with constant magnetic field offset at 2.7 pT due to 
computational limitations.
Simulated for the Rabi frequencies 10 kHz and 100 kHz.

archive_SingleQuditOffsim01.m is the main script to obtain the results.
