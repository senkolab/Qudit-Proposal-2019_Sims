Fidelity for qudit Fourier transform gate. d=3 and d=5. 300 sample size for d=3, 300 sample size for d=5.
Random noise and random initial encoded state.
Self_error_arrays are error of inner product of the final state with itself.
Corrected g-factor for 3-level qudits from Mag Noise Experiment 2.
Increased time-step resolution for 3-level qudits to minimize "negative" errors.
