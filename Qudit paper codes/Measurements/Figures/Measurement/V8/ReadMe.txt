This version allows you to input a measurement sequence, and it calculates
all of the coherent sweeps through unwanted transitions, all of the relevant
off resonant transitions, everything. It also displays results from each step 
of the way

Some improvements to be made: 
Make the code automatically generate a measurement sequence - optimizing it
based on weighting the motional sidebands by eta^n, and reducing this overall
total

Optimize over detuning as well
