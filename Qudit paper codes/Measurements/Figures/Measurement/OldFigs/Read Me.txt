Overall-Measurement2 
Just assuming off-resonant coupling to a single level, and initial detuning 
set at midway to that level

Overall-Measurement3 and Population_Transfer_Adiabatic3 
Assume off-resonant coupling to all levels, with clebsch gordan
coefficients taken into account (incorrectly for different F's), and the detuning set 
much closer to the nearest level

Overall-Measurement4 has off-resonant coupling to all levels with correct clebsch gordan 
coefficients

5: F->F' coefficient added in, detuning increased to 200kHz away from nearest transition

6: changed to 1.6MHz so we don't sweep through motional sideband

7: Took into account motional sidebands as coherent adiabatic transitions at reduced rabi rates

8: Added in motional sidebands from other transitions (not encodings)
