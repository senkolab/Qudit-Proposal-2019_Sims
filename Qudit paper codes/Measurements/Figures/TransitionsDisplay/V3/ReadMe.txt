This version works for measurement sequences, so you can see what energy levels are
relevant at all during the entire measurement. This allows you to see that
hiding works, for example. If do a measurement sequence, it will not show freqs
that would have shown up for a level you choose not to shelve, or for a level
you choose not to deshelve. 
It's a way to test new measurement sequences, to make sure you're not driving
an aggregiously unwanted transition.
